- **Use kebab-case for positional variables**
  - Variables like `<component-name>` and `<route-name>` must be kebab-case
  - Never use PascalCase, camelCase, or spaces in variables
- **Quote command names only when they contain spaces**
  - Example: `ng "Add Nextgen Pagebuilder Block" about-us`
  - Do not quote variables
- **Run multiple commands by separating with `;` (PowerShell/Unix)**
  - Example: `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block hero; ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block about-us`
- **Discover commands with `ng list-all`**
  - Shows built-in templates, args-based commands, native/user commands, clipboard, and project-specific commands
- **Check help for args-based commands**
  - `ng <command-name> --help` shows flags for commands in `app/commands/args`

## Overview

Nextgen is installed and available as `ng`. This guide covers day-to-day usage and the strict conventions the CLI expects so your commands run consistently.

Check [nextgen-cli-commands.mdc](.mdc:.nextgen/nexgen-cli-commands.mdc) to learn all commands.


## Running commands (templates and args-based)

- **Syntax**: `ng <command-name> [variables...] [--flags...]`
- **Command name**: Use quotes if it contains spaces, e.g. `ng "Add Nextgen Pagebuilder Block" about-us`
- **Variables**: Positional arguments map to template placeholders in order (e.g. `{{.ComponentName}}`)
- **Flags**: Primarily for args-based commands (see help)

### Non-negotiable casing rule

- **ALWAYS** use kebab-case for every positional value you pass to `ng`
- **NEVER** use PascalCase, camelCase, or spaces
- Convert any provided name to kebab-case before running

#### ✅ Correct
- `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block about-us`
- `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block hero-banner`
- `ng add-nextgen-slug-route product-categories`

#### ❌ Incorrect (do not generate)
- `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block AboutUs`
- `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block aboutUs`
- `ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block "About Us"`

### Running multiple commands in one line

PowerShell and most shells support `;` as a separator:
```bash
ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block hero; ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block about-us; ng add-nextgen-pagebuilder-block contact-us
```

## Getting help

- **General help**: `ng --help` or `ng -h` (shows global usage/flags; does not list all commands)
- **Command help (args-based only)**: `ng <command-name> --help`
  - Applies to commands defined in `app/commands/args` (e.g., `config`, `native-cmd`, `clipboard-paste`)
  - Example: `ng native-cmd run --help`
